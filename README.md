# MindSpan
*Smart spaced repetition for lasting learning*

MindSpan is a web-based spaced repetition planner that leverages the Ebbinghaus forgetting-curve to optimize learning.  Automatically schedules reviews at scientifically-proven intervals, tracks progress across subjects, and provides analytics to maximize retention. Study smarter with intelligent scheduling that adapts to your learning pace.
Soon we will add analytics and adaptive scheduling.

# What it does 

Mindspan is a modern web-based to-do list + revision planner that helps students retain information more effectively using scientifically-proven spaced repetition techniques. Instead of studying everything mindlessly, Mindspan remember what you studied today and automatically schedules it according to revision schedules optimized for better long term retention. The scheduled task automatically becomes a task on the to-do list on the scheduled day. Stop cramming, start remembering.

# What is Spaced Repetition?

Spaced repetition leverages the psychological spacing effect—the principle that reviewing material at strategically increasing intervals dramatically improves long-term retention. Here we have utilized Ebbinghaus Forgetting curve to optimize study-related tasks.

# Key Features

- *Intelligent Scheduling* - Automatically generates personalized review schedules using spaced repetition algorithms
- *Subject & Topic Management* - Organize your study materials across multiple subjects with ease
- *Progress Tracking* - Visual dashboards show your learning progress and mastery levels
- *Smart Notifications* - Never miss a review session with timely reminders
- *Performance Analytics* - Detailed statistics help you understand your retention patterns
- *Clean Interface* - Distraction-free design keeps you focused on learning

# Why Mindspan?

Traditional study methods rely on repetition and cramming, which lead to poor long-term retention. Mindspan eliminates guesswork by telling you exactly what to review and when, optimizing your study time for maximum effectiveness. Whether you're preparing for exams, learning a new language, or mastering professional certifications, Mindspan adapts to your learning pace.
